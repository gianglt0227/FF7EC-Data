Virtual Currency may be redeemed by you for certain licensed digital items and online services in the Services.\n\nB. Virtual Currency Are Merely Licensed Virtual Goods and Have No Monetary Value. Virtual Currency (and virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) are virtual goods licensed to users and owned at all times by the Company. The license may be revoked by the Company at any time in our discretion. Virtual Currency (and virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) have no monetary value, and you do not have any personal property rights in the Virtual Currency (or virtual items and services they may be redeemed for). Therefore, Virtual Currency (and virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) may not be traded for cash, currency or any form of property, license or rights except for the products and services that the Company chooses to offer you in its sole discretion. You may not transfer Virtual Currency (or virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) to any other person or entity or receive Virtual Currency (or virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) from any other person or entity for any reason unless explicitly authorized by the Company. Virtual Currency (and virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) may be deleted by the Company for any reason or no reason, with or without notice.\n\nC. Pricing and Purchasing. You may add Virtual Currency to your account by using the payment methods specified for the particular platform you are using to access the Services. You must be authorized to use the payment method chosen and, in the case of minors using a credit or debit card of a parent or guardian, your parent or guardian must expressly agree to allow the use of such payment method. The current prices for Virtual Currency will be available for viewing in the Services. The Company reserves the right to adjust the price for Virtual Currency at any time, in its sole discretion, without notice or reimbursement. You are responsible for the payment of any taxes or other charges relating to the purchase or redemption of Virtual Currency. You may not falsely notify your payment processor that you did not authorize any one-time or automatically recurring charge that you consented to previously. We reserve the right to ban those who commit \"friendly fraud\" from the Services.\n\nD. Limits. In order to protect your security and to deter fraud, the Company may impose limits on the amount of Virtual Currency that you may license per transaction, per day and/or per month. The Company may also limit the maximum amount of Virtual Credits Currency that you may hold in your account at any one time.\n\nE. Usage of Virtual Currency. You may redeem Virtual Currency for certain digital items and/or online services offered within the Services. Such digital items are also revocable licenses for which you have no property interest, and which may be discontinued or deleted at any time. The Company reserves the right to adjust the amount of Virtual Currency due for each digital item and online service at any time, in its sole discretion, without notice or reimbursement. Once redeemed, Virtual Currency will be deducted from your account balance and cannot be used again. You have no right to reverse a transaction once it is completed. However, if the Company determines that an incorrect price (in Virtual Currency) is identified for a digital item or online service, it reserves the right to reverse, adjust and/or nullify any such transaction.\n\nF. NO CASH REFUNDS. EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW OR AN APPROPRIATE PLATFORM OWNER, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO RECEIVE A CASH REFUND FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL CURRENCY. \n\nG. Expiration of Virtual Currency. Virtual Currency issued by the Company currently do not expire, but the Company reserves the right to alter or terminate operation of the Services, any Virtual Currency, and to revoke the licenses to them, at any time without notice. In other words, you may redeem Virtual Currency for as long as the Company chooses to make Virtual Currency redeemable for digital items and services, which the Company has no obligation to do. Accordingly, we encourage you to redeem Virtual Currency sooner rather than later.\n\nH. Improper Acquisition/Usage of Virtual Currency. You agree that the Company has the absolute right to manage and regulate the Virtual Currency and all licenses for digital items and services related thereto in its sole discretion. If the Company suspects any fraudulent, abusive or unlawful activity with respect to your Virtual Currency balance, or your acquisition of licensed digital items or Services associated therewith, then the Company may reduce or liquidate your Virtual Currency balance and/or any or all licenses for digital items and Services related thereto, or deactivate, suspend or terminate access thereto.\n\nI. Termination of　Account. If you (a) are banned for any reason, including violation of these TOS, or (b) voluntarily terminate your account, then the Company reserves the right to delete the account and all Virtual Currency and all licenses for items and services related thereto permanently.\n\nJ. Changes to the Virtual Currency. We reserve the right to change the way that the Virtual Currency and all licenses for items and services related thereto operates, or to terminate the Virtual Credits System and all licenses for items and services related thereto altogether, at any time, in its sole discretion, without notice. Any such changes shall take effect immediately upon posting of the change.\n\nK. VIRTUAL CURRENCY WAIVER. BY ACCEPTING THESE TOS OR BY USING THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY, YOU AGREE NOT TO ASSERT OR BRING ANY CLAIM OR SUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY, ITS PARENTS OR AFFILIATES, ITS BACK-END SERVICE PROVIDERS, THE PLATFORM LICENSORS, OR THEIR EMPLOYEES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO VIRTUAL CURRENCY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIM WHICH IS BASED ON A THEORY THAT YOU \"OWN\" VIRTUAL CURRENCY (OR ANY VIRTUAL ITEMS OR SERVICES), OR THAT YOU LOST THE \"VALUE\" OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY (OR ANY VIRTUAL ITEMS OR SERVICES) AS A RESULT OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY (OR ANY VIRTUAL ITEMS OR SERVICES) DELETION OR ACCOUNT TERMINATION, OR FOR ANY MODIFICATIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY REQUIRED TO ACCESS CERTAIN VIRTUAL ITEMS OR SERVICES, OR THE REMOVAL OF ACCESS TO VIRTUAL CURRENCY (OR ANY VIRTUAL ITEMS OR SERVICES), OR FOR ANY MALFUNCTIONS AND/OR \"BUGS\" IN ANY VIRTUAL CURRENCY (OR ANY VIRTUAL ITEMS OR SERVICES).\n\nL. Issuance of Virtual Currency.

(“Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) from Japan. These Terms of Service and any Additional Terms (defined below) thereof (collectively, the “TOS”) govern your use of the Services, regardless of how you access or use it and where you are located. By using the Services, you acknowledge and accept our Privacy Policy and consent to the collection, storage, sharing, and use of your data in accordance with the Privacy Policy. If you change your mind, you must immediately uninstall the Application and/or discontinue the use of the Services. By installing the Application and/or using the Services, you further agree that we may change, alter, or modify the settings or configurations on your Device (defined below) in order to allow or optimize your use of the Services.\n\nOverview\n\nThese TOS explain the terms and conditions under which you agree to use the Services.

If you do not agree, or want to end your agreement with us, you must uninstall the Application or discontinue use of the Services.\n\n• You may only use the Content (defined below) contained in the Services in connection with your permitted activities on the Services and not in an offline environment or in connection with another application or web site unless we explicitly permit it. \n\n• You have no ownership in the Services or any virtual currency or virtual items used in the Services. You have only a limited license to use them pursuant to these TOS. All or part of the virtual currency or virtual items may be deleted or the operation of the Services may be terminated in our sole discretion, with or without notice to you. \n\n• Except as set forth explicitly in our Privacy Policy, you and the Company do not have a confidential relationship due to your use of the Services or your communications to us through or related to the Services.

Virtual Currency (and virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) are virtual goods licensed to users and owned at all times by the Company. The license may be revoked by the Company at any time in our discretion. Virtual Currency (and virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) have no monetary value, and you do not have any personal property rights in the Virtual Currency (or virtual items and services they may be redeemed for). Therefore, Virtual Currency (and virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) may not be traded for cash, currency or any form of property, license or rights except for the products and services that the Company chooses to offer you in its sole discretion. You may not transfer Virtual Currency (or virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) to any other person or entity or receive Virtual Currency (or virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) from any other person or entity for any reason unless explicitly authorized by the Company. Virtual Currency (and virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) may be deleted by the Company for any reason or no reason, with or without notice.\n\nC. Pricing and Purchasing. You may add Virtual Currency to your account by using the payment methods specified for the particular platform you are using to access the Services. You must be authorized to use the payment method chosen and, in the case of minors using a credit or debit card of a parent or guardian, your parent or guardian must expressly agree to allow the use of such payment method. The current prices for Virtual Currency will be available for viewing in the Services. The Company reserves the right to adjust the price for Virtual Currency at any time, in its sole discretion, without notice or reimbursement. You are responsible for the payment of any taxes or other charges relating to the purchase or redemption of Virtual Currency. You may not falsely notify your payment processor that you did not authorize any one-time or automatically recurring charge that you consented to previously. We reserve the right to ban those who commit \"friendly fraud\" from the Services.\n\nD. Limits. In order to protect your security and to deter fraud, the Company may impose limits on the amount of Virtual Currency that you may license per transaction, per day and/or per month. The Company may also limit the maximum amount of Virtual Credits Currency that you may hold in your account at any one time.\n\nE. Usage of Virtual Currency. You may redeem Virtual Currency for certain digital items and/or online services offered within the Services. Such digital items are also revocable licenses for which you have no property interest, and which may be discontinued or deleted at any time. The Company reserves the right to adjust the amount of Virtual Currency due for each digital item and online service at any time, in its sole discretion, without notice or reimbursement. Once redeemed, Virtual Currency will be deducted from your account balance and cannot be used again. You have no right to reverse a transaction once it is completed. However, if the Company determines that an incorrect price (in Virtual Currency) is identified for a digital item or online service, it reserves the right to reverse, adjust and/or nullify any such transaction.\n\nF. NO CASH REFUNDS. EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW OR AN APPROPRIATE PLATFORM OWNER, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO RECEIVE A CASH REFUND FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL CURRENCY. \n\nG. Expiration of Virtual Currency. Virtual Currency issued by the Company currently do not expire, but the Company reserves the right to alter or terminate operation of the Services, any Virtual Currency, and to revoke the licenses to them, at any time without notice. In other words, you may redeem Virtual Currency for as long as the Company chooses to make Virtual Currency redeemable for digital items and services, which the Company has no obligation to do. Accordingly, we encourage you to redeem Virtual Currency sooner rather than later.\n\nH. Improper Acquisition/Usage of Virtual Currency. You agree that the Company has the absolute right to manage and regulate the Virtual Currency and all licenses for digital items and services related thereto in its sole discretion. If the Company suspects any fraudulent, abusive or unlawful activity with respect to your Virtual Currency balance, or your acquisition of licensed digital items or Services associated therewith, then the Company may reduce or liquidate your Virtual Currency balance and/or any or all licenses for digital items and Services related thereto, or deactivate, suspend or terminate access thereto.\n\nI. Termination of　Account. If you (a) are banned for any reason, including violation of these TOS, or (b) voluntarily terminate your account, then the Company reserves the right to delete the account and all Virtual Currency and all licenses for items and services related thereto permanently.\n\nJ. Changes to the Virtual Currency. We reserve the right to change the way that the Virtual Currency and all licenses for items and services related thereto operates, or to terminate the Virtual Credits System and all licenses for items and services related thereto altogether, at any time, in its sole discretion, without notice. Any such changes shall take effect immediately upon posting of the change.\n\nK. VIRTUAL CURRENCY WAIVER. BY ACCEPTING THESE TOS OR BY USING THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY, YOU AGREE NOT TO ASSERT OR BRING ANY CLAIM OR SUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY, ITS PARENTS OR AFFILIATES, ITS BACK-END SERVICE PROVIDERS, THE PLATFORM LICENSORS, OR THEIR EMPLOYEES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO VIRTUAL CURRENCY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIM WHICH IS BASED ON A THEORY THAT YOU \"OWN\" VIRTUAL CURRENCY (OR ANY VIRTUAL ITEMS OR SERVICES), OR THAT YOU LOST THE \"VALUE\" OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY (OR ANY VIRTUAL ITEMS OR SERVICES) AS A RESULT OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY (OR ANY VIRTUAL ITEMS OR SERVICES) DELETION OR ACCOUNT TERMINATION, OR FOR ANY MODIFICATIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY REQUIRED TO ACCESS CERTAIN VIRTUAL ITEMS OR SERVICES, OR THE REMOVAL OF ACCESS TO VIRTUAL CURRENCY (OR ANY VIRTUAL ITEMS OR SERVICES), OR FOR ANY MALFUNCTIONS AND/OR \"BUGS\" IN ANY VIRTUAL CURRENCY (OR ANY VIRTUAL ITEMS OR SERVICES).\n\nL.
